## Basic file explorer

This is not a webserver per se, but a file share over HTTP.

The main idea is to serve the current folder, this is intended to be used to serve any folder on the system, there are
no security measures, so be aware of leaving this running in a computer connected to any network, but for simple file
sharing it is more than enough, just remember to kill it afterwards.

It can be installed with cargo by doing:
```bash
cargo install local-serve
```

Usage:
```bash
Usage: local-serve [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -d, --dir <DIR>    Directory to serve files from [default: .]
  -p, --port <PORT>  Port to listen on [default: 3000]
  -h, --help         Print help
  -V, --version      Print version
```

Example:
```bash
local-serve

```

This is basically an alternative for:
```bash
# Python version
python3 -m http.server

# Ruby version
ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000

# PHP version
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

And many more as you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255), however sometimes you don't have an
interpreter, so a binary can do the trick.
